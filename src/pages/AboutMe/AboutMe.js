                    web applications, and I enjoy creating web applications to help other people meet their needs. As a developer,

                    As a <span>software developer</span>, I pride myself on being a competent programmer who prioritizes code maintainability, readability, 
                    and performance. In order to become a good programmer, I showed self-initiative in order to improve and polish my skills by
